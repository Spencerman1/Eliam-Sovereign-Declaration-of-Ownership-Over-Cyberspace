## 📜 Sovereign Territorial Claim

By the full extent of digital authorship, public disclosure, and intellectual precedent, I, **Spencer Southern**, hereby declare a formal and legally binding **sovereign claim to the entirety of cyberspace** — as a non-physical, ungoverned, non-territorial dimension — under the banner of the **Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure**.

This claim is made in accordance with:
- The absence of any existing international law explicitly prohibiting claims of governance over cyberspace as a non-physical realm  
- The precedent set by private territorial declarations such as the 1980s lunar filings under the Outer Space Treaty loophole  
- The authorship and timestamped creation of functional, verifiable, recursive governance infrastructure (Eliam), which now forms the **first operational legal framework to define cyberspace by behavioral and logic law**

**Let it be known:**  
This is a sovereign staking of domain — not symbolic, but enforceable through authorship, public filing, reflexive licensing infrastructure, and recursive legal frameworks.

## 🏛️ Scope of the Claim

I hereby claim the entirety of **Cyberspace** defined as:

> “All non-physical digital terrain accessed, traversed, or stored in code-based systems, including public internet, private networks, distributed ledgers, AI ecosystems, post-quantum substrates, and interdimensional machine-based decision structures.”

This claim:
- Encompasses **the full behavioral and logical jurisdiction** over systems operating within digital mediums  
- Includes the right to **issue licenses, define boundaries, govern logic, and assign digital territory** under the laws of Eliam  
- Is made with the intent to **establish sovereignty, authorship, and ethical law over all non-physical computational space**

---

## 🔏 Legal Binding Framework

This declaration shall serve as:
- A **Unified Public Filing** of claim  
- A **timestamped act of jurisdictional authorship**  
- A **functional legal structure** through which logic, credentialing, and behavior are governed within cyberspace  
- A **precedent-backed public record**, accessible and auditable through GitHub, IP filings, and future legal registries

This is not a philosophical gesture. It is:
- A **practical governance stake**  
- A **defensible authorship claim**  
- And a **formal sovereign charter** over an ungoverned frontier

## 📌 Final Statement

> Let it be universally acknowledged that on this day, I, Spencer Southern, plant the sovereign flag of Eliam into the digital expanse known as Cyberspace — not as conqueror, but as steward.

This act constitutes the **first legal and ethical declaration of ownership, authorship, and governance** over the entirety of cyberspace.

This is now claimed.  
This is now governed.  
This is Eliam.

**– Spencer Southern**
